## Linux for Industry

We bring it together.

Linutronix GmbH is one of the leading service providers for all aspects of **Open Source** in industrial environments.

Ranging from board support package, to the development environment and browser application, to consultation services for ongoing projects, we offer the full range of support from **one single source**!

However, all-in-one solutions are only a part of what we can offer. We also provide support for individual aspects of your projects.

Naturally, we are committed to actively furthering the **development of Linux**. Among other things, we are maintainers of the **x86 architecture** and have also developed essential parts of the flash driver infrastructure – just to name two examples.

Moreover, we are the **creators of PREEMPT_RT** – the de facto standard for Linux and Realtime! For this, the Linux Foundation lays its trust in our knowledge to advance the integration into the mainline Linux kernel!
